# jdb ()jason's debugger)

Based on Sy Brand's "Building a Debugger" book, this is my attempt to implement the debugger in rust.

The name is intentionally confusing, overlapping `jdb` with the GOAT debugger `gdb`, as well as overlapping with `jdbc`. 
The latter is entertaining as I've spent damn near two decades in databass-land, so yet another "db" project (albeit a debugger this time).
